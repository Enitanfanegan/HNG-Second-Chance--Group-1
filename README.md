# HNG-Second-Chance--Group-1

## Contributing

We're working with five branches

- `master`
- `Develop`
- `Frontend-track`
- `Backend-track`
- `Design-track`

Our `master` branch is solely for deployment and should not be touched!

Firstly fork this repo and then when your code is ready create a new Pull Request (PR) to the particular track your working on. e.g you're working on frontend code, you create a Pull Request to `Frontend-track`. If you're working on backend, you create a Pull Request to the `Backend-track` branch.

NOTE: The designers don't need to create a PR. Their designs should be committed directly to `Design-track`

We'll bring FE and BE code to `develop` and when we're ready to test.
Only when we're good to go, that's when we merge with `develop` with `master` branch and deploy.

NOTE: Please always include details of what you worked on in your commit and Pull Request messages, with possible screenshots.
Also remember to `pull` first to update your local repo before working and making a PR.
